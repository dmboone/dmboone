👋🏾 Hi, I’m @dmboone!

A creative at heart, I enjoy bringing visions to life in the digital and physical sphere.

I recently graduated from Clemson University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Digital Production Arts and am now working at IBM as
a software developer. I’m currently interested in front end development with an eye towards eventually becoming a full stack developer.
Take a look around and see what I've been currently learning here on Github!

Vist my website at [destinyboone.com](https://destinybooone.com) to learn more about me and to see some of my coding projects as well as my art!
Also feel free to connect with me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/destiny-boone-18010b176/)
